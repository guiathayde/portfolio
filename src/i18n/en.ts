        'I am very familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript, they were the technologies that I had the most contact with at the beginning of my programming career. In addition to these, I also have a lot of experience with the Nodejs ecosystem, such as ReactJS and React Native, due to the courses I completed at Alura and Rocketseat, and the work developed in the UTFPR project, NÓS - Nosso Olhar Solidário, also in the internship in the development area Android, React Native, React and Angular at Ubivis and in another UTFPR extension project for web development called Amigos dos Jardinetes.
